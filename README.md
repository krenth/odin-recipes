# odin-recipes

Summary:

In my first project for the curriculum within The Odin Project, I will be creating a basic HTML wesbite. This website will include a homepage that links to 3 other pages that will all be named after different recipes of my choice, populating them with various types of information.

Skills Demonstrated:

 - The creation and cloning of a Github repository onto my local machine
 - Using Git to manage changes, workflow, and documentation of my project
 - Using the linux-based terminal to navigate, create, and order different files and directories based on the requirements for the project
 - My knowledge of structuring a website, as well as my knowledge using images, links, and other basic, yet useful, information pertaining to HTML
